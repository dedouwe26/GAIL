For starters there are usage examples that show the fundementals to get started:
<ul>
<li>Hello Triangle 📐 (draw a triangle) [<a href="https://github.com/dedouwe26/GAIL/tree/main/examples/HelloTriangle">Code</a>]</li>
<li>From files 📃 (create things from files) [<a href="https://github.com/dedouwe26/GAIL/tree/main/examples/FromFiles">Code</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building ⚒️</h2>
Most releases come pre-built, but if you want to build an example project or just build it, <br/>then follow these steps: <br/>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0">dotnet 8.0</a> installed or higher.</li>
<li>Go to the folder of the project you want to build and open a terminal there.</li>
<li>If you want to build the Nuget Package and you're in the GAIL project, run <code>dotnet pack</code><br/>
Else run <code>dotnet run</code> to run it, or <code>dotnet build</code> to build it.
</li>
</ol>
